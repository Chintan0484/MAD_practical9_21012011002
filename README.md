AIM: What is Frame by Frame Animation? What is Twin Animation? How can you achieve edge-to-edge content display in your app?  Create Android Application to demonstrate Frame by frame animation and splash screen to demonstrate twin animation according to below instructions.

1)Create MainActivity according to below UI design.

2)Create SplashActivity according to Video

3)Create gradient Rectangle by using <gradient> tag in <shape> tag for background of SplashActivity. Use radial rectangle with x = 0.9, y =0.9, radius = 1500. Start Color pink and End Color blue. shape should be rectangle

4)Add these all in project: <animation-list>, oneShot attribute, <set> tag, android:startOffset = 100, android:duration=1000, <scale> tag, <translate> tag, <rotate> tag, <alpha> tag


answer:-
Frame by Frame Animation:
Frame by frame animation, also known as traditional animation or cel animation, is a technique where a sequence of individual frames or images is displayed in rapid succession to create the illusion of motion. Each frame contains a slightly different image, and when these frames are played back in quick succession, it gives the appearance of continuous motion. This is the same technique used in classic hand-drawn animation and stop-motion animation. In digital animation, frame by frame animation can be created by producing and displaying a series of images, each with small incremental changes from the previous one. This technique is commonly used for creating animations with a hand-drawn or stop-motion look.

Twin Animation:
I'm not familiar with the term "Twin Animation" in the context of animation techniques or terminology. It's possible that it may be a less common or industry-specific term, or it could be a typo or misinterpretation of another term. If you have additional context or details about what you mean by "Twin Animation," please provide more information so I can try to assist you further.

Edge-to-Edge Content Display in Your App:
Achieving edge-to-edge content display in your app typically involves designing and implementing your user interface to make the most efficient use of the available screen real estate. Here are some general principles and techniques you can use to achieve edge-to-edge content display in your app:

Responsive Design: Ensure that your app's user interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. Use layout constraints, flexible layouts, or grid systems to make the most of the available space.

Full-Screen Mode: Take advantage of the full-screen mode on the device, which hides the system status bar, navigation bar, and other distractions. This can give your app more screen space.

Edge-to-Edge Elements: Design your interface elements, such as buttons, text, and images, to extend to the edges of the screen where appropriate. Avoid unnecessary padding or margins.

Use Scrolling: If your content is too long to fit on a single screen, use scrolling to allow users to access additional content. This keeps the primary content area as edge-to-edge as possible.

Navigation Patterns: Consider using navigation patterns like tab bars or side menus to make efficient use of screen space while providing access to different sections of your app.
